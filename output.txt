After much consideration, it was decided that they would start a corporation known as Winchester Orchard Supply, Inc.\n\nDuring 1971, our company entered the construction industry by becoming a Bobcat\u00ae dealer. Winchester Orchard Supply, Inc. would diversify by offering construction, outdoor power, and material handling equipment.\n\nFinally, as our company expanded its footprint to meet the needs of our customers in the Tri-state area, we became a Toyota forklift dealer in 1981.\n\nToday Winchester Orchard Supply is known as Winchester Equipment Company. Our name might have changed but our commitment to meeting your agricultural, construction, material handling, and outdoor power equipment needs has remained constant.\n\nWe proudly represent, sell, and service equipment for Bobcat\u00ae, Kubota, Toyota forklifts, Stihl\u00ae, eXmark, Honda Power, Bandit Industries, Cam Trailers, Cima, Durand Wayland, Jacto, Rinieri, and many other brands.\n\nWe have experienced growth over the years and have expanded to four other locations. Bobcat\u00ae of Northern Virginia, located in Bristow, Virginia, opened in 1991. Bobcat\u00ae of Tidewater, located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, opened in 2010. Bobcat\u00ae of Richmond, located in Ashland, Virginia, joined our team in 2012. Finally, Valley Equipment Company, located in Harrisonburg, Virginia, came on in 2016.\n\nWe continue our commitment to excellent customer service at all five locations by offering top manufacturing lines backed by quality parts, a large rental fleet, and factory-certified technicians to service your equipment.\n\n#### Customers for Life!\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Us\n\nCall us at 1 (800) 323-3581 or come by today and experience our superior service and selection!

After much consideration, it was decided that they would start a corporation known as Winchester Orchard Supply, Inc.\n\nDuring 1971, our company entered the construction industry by becoming a Bobcat\u00ae dealer. Winchester Orchard Supply, Inc. would diversify by offering construction, outdoor power, and material handling equipment.\n\nFinally, as our company expanded its footprint to meet the needs of our customers in the Tri-state area, we became a Toyota forklift dealer in 1981.\n\nToday Winchester Orchard Supply is known as Winchester Equipment Company. Our name might have changed but our commitment to meeting your agricultural, construction, material handling, and outdoor power equipment needs has remained constant.\n\nWe proudly represent, sell, and service equipment for Bobcat\u00ae, Kubota, Toyota forklifts, Stihl\u00ae, eXmark, Honda Power, Bandit Industries, Cam Trailers, Cima, Durand Wayland, Jacto, Rinieri, and many other brands.\n\nWe have experienced growth over the years and have expanded to four other locations. Bobcat\u00ae of Northern Virginia, located in Bristow, Virginia, opened in 1991. Bobcat\u00ae of Tidewater, located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, opened in 2010. Bobcat\u00ae of Richmond, located in Ashland, Virginia, joined our team in 2012. Finally, Valley Equipment Company, located in Harrisonburg, Virginia, came on in 2016.\n\nWe continue our commitment to excellent customer service at all five locations by offering top manufacturing lines backed by quality parts, a large rental fleet, and factory-certified technicians to service your equipment.\n\n#### Customers for Life!\n\n* * *\n\n### Contact Us\n\nCall us at 1 (800) 323-3581 or come by today and experience our superior service and selection!

Brandon's always going the extra mile to help out, I'm a tree climber and I'm responsible for several thousand acres of trees on one of the largest farms in the area and so I don't have a lot of time to go drive around and get equipment and supplies every month. I started buying from Winchester equipment a few years back and kept coming back for a lot of it because he actually was a climber himself and knows the gear. Now I get almost everything from Winchester Equipment, even fuel for the saws because he brings everything I need to do the job month in month out right to the farm. Can't beat that. But my shout out this evening is for his really going the extra mile this week and identifying a leak in my cars radiator. I was losing coolant but couldn't find the leak, so when he came out this week to drop off my fuel and some hardware ordered I asked him about it. Not his job description I know but with Brandon's knowledge of all things mechanical I asked if he'd mind taking a quick look before heading onto his next delivery. He did and in less than 2 minutes he pinpointed the leak for me to the exact spot. Can't thank him enough! Really helped me out there big time. Thanks Brandon and thanks Winchester Equipment for having guys like Brandon on your team!\n    \n    Chris Weber, Marshall, VA\n    \n    Store Location: Winchester\n    \n*   Overall\n    \n    5 Star Overall Rating\n    \n    8/3/21\n    \n    The sales and service is attentive if we need to purchase or have questions on existing equipment.
